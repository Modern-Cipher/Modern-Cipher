- 👋 Hi, I’m @Modern-Cipher
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new tech and code languages, particularly exploring advancements in areas like serverless architecture, cross-platform mobile development (beyond native Android), and UI/UX design trends.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to deepen my understanding of Laravel, React Native, Go, or advanced CSS techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting full-stack web projects, innovative Android applications, or even contribute to open-source design systems.
- 📫 How to reach me mdctechservices@gmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: I can probably design a decent prototype for an app idea before my coffee gets cold!
